# Output parser

The output parser analyzes the output generated by the traffic generators and prints statistics about faulty or missing packets.

## Preparation

Pipe the output of simulation to a text file. For example:

`startSim.sh | tee /tmp/sim_output.log`

## Running the output parser

Run the script with the log file generated in the previous section as a parameter:

`python3 output_parser.py /tmp/sim_output.log`

**NOTE:** If the script tells you that you have un-received packets, first make sure you run the simulation long enough for all packets to arrive in their destination!
